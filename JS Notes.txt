Data Types:-

	* typeof determines the variable type
	
Const, Var & Let:-

	* we re-assign number of values to let and we can leave it without assigning a value also.
	* we cannot re-assign new values to const keyword and always we need to assign a value to it.
	* we can also use variables without declaring

String & Templates:-

	* use double quotes for a string, if u have a need for single quote in between
	* or u can also use `` this to write.
	
Type Conversion & Coercion:-

	* to convert string to number use number()
	* if we use number() to string it will give NaN
	* if number written in string format is either multiplied, subtracted and divide then the output is a number itself not a string.
	
Truthy & Falsy:-

	* falsy values are: 0,'',undefined, NaN, null  
	* any value other than that is true
	* if we use Boolean() we will get false value
	
Functions:-
	* a variable can hold one value, But a function can hold 2-3 lines of code.
	* we can use a function any number of times in the code.
	* functions are just values in Javascript, The main difference between function declaration and function expression is 
	  that the function declaration can be called before the function also.
	  
	  
Arrow Function :-
	  
	* const CalcAge3= birthYear=> 2022-birthYear ;
	* If we have multiple parameters : const yearsUntilRetirement = (birthYear,firstName)=> {}
	
	
Scoping:-
	
	$ In a Block scope
		* if const and let are written they cannot be accessed outside of the if block.
		* if var is written inside it can be used outside the if block, as var is function scoped.

	$ In Strict mode
		* If we write a function in a block, then it cannot be accessed outside the block
		
	$ Without strict mode
		* If we write a function in a block, then it can be accessed outside the block also.
